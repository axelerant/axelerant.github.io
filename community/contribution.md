_This document explains how Axelerant defines contributions with respect to KPIs._

## What is an open source community contribution?

An open source community contribution is defined as any piece of documentation (code or otherwise) or any offline activity that is documented and available in the public space for other community members to use.

### Axelerant’s intent

While we understand the above is an open source contribution **Axelerant’s intent is to encourage more meaningful contributions for the community & for the organisation.**

* Additional contributions over your set KPI number will always be a bonus when applying for event sponsorships, salary corrections, etc.
* Above mentioned contributions are valid for all open source projects. Contributions to multiple open source projects can have brownie points.

## Important Notes before you continue reading:

* If you have doubts when contributing, please check with #community.
* If there are kinds of contributions that aren’t listed here, please raise in #community
* Any offline activities need to be documented and made available publicly in a presentable format for the community.

## What is considered as 1 Community Contribution

While each contribution is valuable, we all know how each one has a varied investment of time. Which is why we wanted to quantify how each kind of contribution would count towards your KPI of community contribution count and be fair to all kinds of contributors. While we’re not going to hit bull’s eye with our first iteration it’s a starting point in quantifying each kind of contribution.

* 5 _submitted_ valid patches makes for 1 community contribution
* 5 _tested_ patches makes for 1 community contribution.
* Module contribution
* Module porting
* Presentation at a Camp or a Conference with community significance.
* Any significant contribution to an Open Source project besides Drupal.
* Blogs with thought leadership content.
  * Blog should be ready to publish (_approved by Nathan for publishing_) or be published within the quarter. 
  * _Definition: At its core, **thought leadership** is a type of **content** marketing where you tap into the talent, experience and passion inside your business, or from your community, to answer the biggest questions on the minds of your target audience on a particular topic._
  * Get the content approved by the content marketing team before you start working on it.
* Executing a public training.
* Substantial volunteering role at an event.
  * While volunteering at event day activities is important and helps the community, we want you to be more involved and play a more significant role in organising the event or contributing to the event in a way that the event gains more value.
*  Approved internal presentation that can be converted to a public presentation.
*  275 reputation points earned on stackexchange forums per quarter will be considered as 1 contribution.
